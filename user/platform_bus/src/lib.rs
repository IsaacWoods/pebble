//! The **Platform Bus** is a concept of a single, abstract "bus" that all devices in the system hang off. These
//! devices are contributed by various **Bus Drivers**, which register devices with the Platfom Bus when they
//! enumerate their respective physical buses. **Device Drivers** can then register interest with the Platform Bus
//! for a specific class of devices using a **Filter**.
//!
//! Devices on the Platform Bus are described by Properties, which provide both generic and platform-specific
//! information. For example, a device created by the PCI bus driver will have `pci.vendor_id`, `pci.device_id`,
//! `pci.class` and `pci.sub_class` as properties. A Device Driver could use the `class` and `subclass` properties
//! to select all PCI devices of a particular type (e.g. useful for a driver for all EHCI controllers), or the
//! `vendor_id` and `device_id` properties to select a specific device (e.g. useful for a graphics driver for a
//! specific graphics card).
