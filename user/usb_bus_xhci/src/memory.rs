/// The Device Context Base Address Array contains an entry for each enabled port, plus an extra one at index 0 for
/// the Scratchpad Buffer Array. If Max Scratchpad Buffers (a field of `HCSPARAMS2`) is `0`, then the first entry
/// should be cleared to `0`.
///
/// The structure must be aligned on a 64-byte boundary; this is guaranteed as the base address of the area will be
/// page-aligned.
///
/// Device Contexts must be aligned on a 64-byte boundary so the remaining entries are of the form:
/// ```ignore
///   63                                                     6        0

///    +-----------------------------------------------------+--------+

///
/// The physical address of this structure should be loaded into the `Device Context Base Address Array Pointer
/// Register (DCBAAP)` register in the Operational Registers block.
