.extern rust_syscall_entry

/*
 * This is the code that is run when a task executes the `syscall` instruction. The `syscall`
 * instruction:
 *    - has put the `rip` to return to in `rcx`
 *    - has put the `rflags` to return with in `r11`, masked with `IA32_FMASK`
 *    - does not save `rsp`. It is our responsibility to deal with the stack(s).
 *
 * Because we are using the System-V ABI:
 *    - `rbp`, `rbx`, `r12`, `r13`, `r14`, and `r15` must be preserved
 *    - Other registers may be clobbered
 *
 * Values of registers for syscall instructions.
 *     rdi = number
 *     rsi = a
 *     rdx = b
 *     r10 = c
 *     r8  = d
 *     r9  = e
 * This is only different from the Sys-V ABI in that `c` is in `r10` and not `rcx` (because `rcx` is being
 * used by syscall). To call into the Rust function (as long as it is using the C ABI), we only need to
 * move that one parameter.
