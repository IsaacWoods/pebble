# `Mulch`
This crate is a collection of data structures and utility methods that are used around the Poplar kernel and
its supporting libraries. It's kind of like that unfortunate crate/module of a largish project that contains
all the stuff that doesn't have a better home, such as generic data structures and maths stuff.
